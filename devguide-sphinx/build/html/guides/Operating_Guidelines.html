<!-- /TOC --><p>As a development team building services on the RefArch1.5 platform prior to GA release, you will be working on the platform as it is evolving. It will be important to follow the guidelines below to minimize disruptions and ensure we upgrade together on a cadence.</p>

<h2>Dev Environments<a class="headerlink" href="#dev-environments" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Microservices will be deployed and tested in 2 AWS dev environments to allow for platform improvements in one as active EBSCO Next platform development is going on in the other. In PI12, these will be the only environments available<ul>
<li><strong>Current:</strong> Dev teams deploy their microservices to this environment during normal iterations (green below)</li>
<li><strong>Next:</strong> Dev teams may deploy their microservices to this environment in order to test changes required for the next version of the platform (yellow below)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Current and Next environments will be rotated every other iteration in PI12. We will assess how this period works and adjust as necessary.</li>
<li>Rotation will be executed with an automated rebuild, blowing away everything in both environments. We do this to ensure we can recreate environments in an automated way.</li>
<li>Key non-breaking fixes and enhancements will be overlaid onto the Current environment as needed.</li>
