<!-- /TOC --><p>As a development team building services on the RefArch1.5 platform prior to GA release, you will be working on the platform as it is evolving. It will be important to follow the guidelines below to minimize disruptions and ensure we upgrade together on a cadence.</p>
<div class="section" id="dev-environments">
<h2>Dev Environments<a class="headerlink" href="#dev-environments" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Microservices will be deployed and tested in 2 AWS dev environments to allow for platform improvements in one as active EBSCO Next platform development is going on in the other. In PI12, these will be the only environments available</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Current:</strong> Dev teams deploy their microservices to this environment during normal iterations (green below)</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Next:</strong> Dev teams may deploy their microservices to this environment in order to test changes required for the next version of the platform (yellow below)</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Current and Next environments will be rotated every other iteration in PI12. We will assess how this period works and adjust as necessary.</p></li>
<li><p>Rotation will be executed with an automated rebuild, blowing away everything in both environments. We do this to ensure we can recreate environments in an automated way.</p></li>
<li><p>Key non-breaking fixes and enhancements will be overlaid onto the Current environment as needed.</p></li>
</ul>

<h2>Communication and Support<a class="headerlink" href="#communication-and-support" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Dev teams will use the resources below for instructions and to raise issues and questions about deployment to the Next version of the platform.</p>
<p><strong>It is important we direct all discussion to the shared Teams channel so issues and solutions are available to all dev teams.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Release Notes:</p>
<p>The <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/EBSCOIS/platform.training.refarch1.5-devguide/blob/master/guides/Platform_Release_Notes">Platform Release Notes</a> section of this document will describe project changes required to upgrade to the new version of the platform. This will be complete by end of day Thursday, likely sooner.</p>

</li>
<li><p>Egress from microservices/mesh to external services is managed by submitting a Pull Request to a single repository (TBD). PR’s will be reviewed and executed by “Platform Support.”</p></li>
<li><p>Ingress and routing to applications is done with Ambassador gateway (if ready) or by using host header (if not)</p></li>
