# Summary

# RefArch 1.5 Early Access Dev Guide

This document contains developer oriented instructions and information about how to write and deploy services on RefArch 1.5. We are moving quickly to support development of EBSCO Next and other high priority projects before the RefArch 1.5 platform is complete. This dev guide describes how to integrate your services with the platform in its current state, prior to completion of the `RA1.5-DevReady` milestone.

As platform features are released, you can expect the deployment approach to change, taking advantage of automation over manual processes. The guide will be updated to reflect these changes and release notes will clearly communicate to teams the changes they will need to make in their projects as the platform evolves.

__Note:__ For the I4 architecture drop, a distinction will be made between JSB and Node.js services with respect to Development Operating Procedures and Deployment. That distinction will be reflected in there being JSB and Node.js specific documents for those topics until the RefArch1.5 implementation is far enough along to bring them back into alignment.
